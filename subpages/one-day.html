    <p><span class="first-image"><img src="../image/railway6.JPG"></span>I arrived at Chiang Mai Railway Station at 3
      p.m., around two hours before departure.
      The train crossed into towns with poorly-built houses and dilapidated buildings.
      I had heard from locals that the train didn't serve food on board because of Covid-19 restrictions, so I made my
      way to the local 7-11. I bought a ready-to-eat meal, chips, drinks, a pack of gum, a bottle of water, and some
      local desserts.
      Some of the food I got from the local 7-11. I usually have breakfast, dinner, and supper, and it turned out to be
      a huge mistake not to take along more substantial meals. The snacks didn't do much to quell my hunger. I ended up
      wishing
      I had bought some local food from the roadside hawkers to bring on board.

    <p><span class="last-image"><img src="../image/railway7.JPG"></span>Passengers began boarding at around 4.30 p.m.
      Tourists occupied most of the first-class cabins,
      while local students took up many second-class seats. I only saw a handful of people in the third-class sections,
      which were the only passenger cars that were not air-conditioned.
      Throughout my week-long trip to Thailand, I only brought along a small carry-on and a foldable tote.

      As I had never traveled on a rail train before, I was surprised at how much heat the vehicle emitted. It was
      uncomfortable for me to take photographs of the train's exterior, or even stand next to it.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-image "><img src="../image/railway3.jpg"></span>I travel as light as I can during reporting
      trips, especially when I cover the backpacking beat,
      but other passengers brought along many of their belongings which they stowed in the train's luggage compartment.
      Nonetheless, my first impression of the train was positive — it was clean, it was quiet on board, and the
      temperature of the air-conditioning was just right.</p>
    <p class="line-break "></p>
    <p><span class="last-image"><img src="../image/railway5.JPG"></span>Overall, I'd say taking a day train trip across
      Thailand would be better for me looking to catch a glimpse of the country's provinces and natural landscapes.
      I'm glad to have tried the one-day journey once but in hindsight, it's not a trip worth going out of my way for.
