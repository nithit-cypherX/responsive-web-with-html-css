  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-image"><img src="../image/love4.jpg"></span> For the first time in my life, I knew how it was
      to feel the way I did about another person;
      the feeling of love like the way it's described in romance novels and in the movies. It felt real and I was
      confident it was.
      You look into their eyes and see the same stars sparkling in them and it's the first time you'll realize that
      another person feels the same way you feel about them.
      I was floating on cloud nine, high on love and everything was more than fine.</p>
    <p class="line-break"></p>
    <p><span class="last-image "><img src="../image/love7.jpg"></span>There's a first time for everything. But it's
      called first love, because it's also the first time you'll feel what happens when it's over.
      It's the first time you'll feel like someone is ripping through your chest and griping your heart, pulling it out
      and tearing it apart.
      It's the first time you'll cry so hard for another person to the point where you can't breathe. It's the first
      time you'll feel completely helpless, like a kitten that hasn't quite learned how to walk on its own.
      It's the first time you'll feel like you're grabbing onto something only to realize it's all smoke disappearing
      between your fingers. It's the first time you'll blame yourself for something that perhaps wasn't your fault, or
      maybe it was,
      but you'll never know for sure, and it's also the first time you'll be entirely responsible for the way you feel
      inside. </p>

  <div class="image-two">
    <h2>Lover</h2>
  </div>



  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-image image2"><img src="../image/love5.jpg"></span>This was my 'first love' experience. I
      lived through it and I learned. Eventually, I snapped out of my fantasy and began to realize that a first love
      experience is not a young adult novel.
      No matter how hard we wish it was in our time of adolescence, things will not necessarily work out in the end. You
      will not necessarily end up with them. It's a part of life and it happens to the best of everyone.
      When first love ends, you'll wonder if you even knew what love even was in the first place.
      You'll wonder if what you had was real or if you felt that way (or if they felt that way) only because that's what
      romance novels and movies told you how to feel.
      When first love ends, you'll be left feeling lost and alone, sad and confused, and absolutely hopeless. </p>
    <p class="line-break "></p>
    <p><span class="last-image"><img src="../image/love2.jpg"></span>First love hurts when it ends and it leaves you
      second guessing yourself, your self-worth, and who you even are. When first love ends,
      you'll feel there's now a hole in your heart, an absence of a presence, a hollow and empty space, you'll feel like
      something's missing.
      You'll try to put up a brave front to show your strength by telling yourself that you will adjust and your heart
      will heal and become whole again -- even though you don't feel that it will. But in time, when your heart does
      heal,
      it will never be the same. The space your first love used to occupy will remain hollow and empty. The scars will
      always remain and never fade.</p>
