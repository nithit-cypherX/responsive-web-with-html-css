    <p><span class="first-image "><img src="../image/mountain6.JPEG"></span>The drive was short, less than an hour and a
      half from downtown Nashville.
      Our vehicle crept through the park's entrance slowly. I didn't know what to expect.
      My shy feet crushed against the cold pavement, as we walked towards the trailhead.
      A sign read Burgess Falls State Natural Area and warned that the hike to the falls would be moderately strenuous.
      I could feel my stomach drop at the thought of what would lie ahead, but I pushed on. </p>
    <p class="line-break"></p>
    <p><span class="last-image"><img src="../image/mountain5.JPEG"></span>Walking down the trail I made my way slowly up
      the trail, mindful of every pebble in my path as I trailed behind my companions.
      The sound of the wind in the trees gave way to the roaring of the first waterfall. The air seemed to hum with
      energy, causing my breath to catch in my throat.
      The powerful sound of the waterfall was frightening, but it also intrigued me. As the noise grew louder, we
      approached the first overlook.
      To my dismay, I saw that it was blocked off with fencing. A sign explained the park was forced to close it due to
      flood damage.
      I peaked through the trees, trying to get a good look at the first waterfall I had ever seen. My companions told
      me that another waterfall and overlook waited just up the trail,
      so I led the way, more sure of each footstep.

  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-image image2"><img src="../image/mountain4.JPEG"></span>After ascending a steep natural
      staircase, we had arrived at the second overlook. The wooden overlook was empty,
      and I timidly walked up to the edge. We were up so high my stomach dropped again,
      this time right into my tennis shoes. It felt like the ground below my feet fell away,
      like I was floating in a space where only two things could exist, the waterfall and me.
      To take in all that I was seeing felt impossible. There in the center of the vast gorge, was the largest waterfall
      at the park.
      Jutting over the edge off a 100 feet drop cascaded an incredible amount of water. Hues of color scattered the
      walls of the gorge, and a rainbow hung at the base, decorated by mist.
      I wanted to reach the source and feel the water, so we continued down the trail.</p>
    <p class="line-break "></p>
    <p><span class="last-image"><img src="../image/mountain3.jpeg"></span>On the hike back to the parking lot, I was
      silent, brain abuzz with thoughts of my next visit.
      We drove off as slowly as we came in, but I felt a shift deep inside.
      I was grateful for the mind-blowing experience that is Burgess Falls State Park and the change of perspective
      that I'll carry with me from this day forward. </p>
